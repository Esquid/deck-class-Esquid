# Assignment: Custom Class

You will create a `Deck()` class in Python. The `Deck()` class is sketched out for you in `deck-assignment.py`,
where I've also given you lists of ranks and suits.

Save your solution as `deck.py`.

Remember, your solution must have the following:
* an `__init__` method that initializes a shuffled deck.
* a `__repr__` method
* a `deal()` method that returns a single card. This card should no longer be part of the deck.

I've included a `__len__` method so that the `len()` function will work on your deck, allowing you to 
check the behavior of your `deal()` method.

Good luck!
